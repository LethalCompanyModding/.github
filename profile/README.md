## Hi there 👋

This is the Lethal Company Modding server community repository. We store all of the important community focused documentation for the Lethal Company Thunderstore section here as well as a selection of packages that have either been dedicated to the community or have permissive licenses and have been abandoned.

## Applying to become a community maintainer

Simply join the community discord server and speak with staff about becoming a community maintainer on any mod in the repo or any permissively licensed mod that is no longer being maintained by its author.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
